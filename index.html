<br>I am an associate professor at the University of Seoul, working in Department of Statistics and leading Data Intelligence Lab.
My research interests lie in various applications for data processing and management in language and vision domains.
I am currently working on training knowledge-grounded conversation models and exploring large language models for different modalities.
